of the system.

administrator)
c. Check if rows and xml are in correct format:
i. First row – row id(integer)
ii. Second row – product sku(string)
iii. Third row – in stock/out of stock(integer 0/1) 0 = no, 1 = yes.
d. Update product accordingly to the uploaded XML file:
i. Find product by it&#39;s SKU (second row in XML)
ii. Update stock(third row in xml).
iii. Remove the XML file after updating is done.
iv. Log the updated products:
1. Log updating date
